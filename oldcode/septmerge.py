For nlxx: I need to split the line, then split line[2] by -.
But this will give me a list within a list. 
For mlxx: I need to remove all of the diacritics (as well as split it
like I did in roots.py.

The books in mlxx aren't just shortened forms of the dlxx, they can also be
different kinds of abbrefviations like "Kgs" and "PsSol".
